Psynteract OpenSesame integration
=================================

**Easily build real-time interactive experiments with OpenSesame.**

This repository provides the OpenSesame integration of the *Psynteract*
libraries. The documentation of the plug-ins can be found in its [own
repository] (https://github.com/psynteract/psynteract-docs/).

General information
-------------------

The psynteract-os plug-ins are developed jointly by Pascal Kieslich and
Felix Henninger, with a focus on the OpenSesame integration and the
underlying Python library and backend, respectively.

They are published under the `GNU General Public License (version
3) <LICENSE>`__.

Installation
------------

To install the plug-ins, please `download the latest release
<https://github.com/psynteract/psynteract-os/releases>`__. More
information on installing the plug-ins, can be found in the
[documentation]
(https://github.com/psynteract/psynteract-docs/blob/master/installation.md).

Shoulders of giants
-------------------

Psynteract depends heavily on several additional libraries that are
included in the release archives, but not contained in this repository.
In particular, we are indebted to the authors of and contributors to
`*PyCouchDB* (written by Andrey Antukh) <https://pycouchdb.readthedocs.org/>`__
and `*Requests* (by Kenneth Reitz and collaborators)
<http://python-requests.org/>`__. The OpenSesame integration also incorporates
our own `Python library <https://github.com/psynteract/psynteract-py>`__. Of
course, none of this would be possible without the excellent work of the
`OpenSesame development team <http://osdoc.cogsci.nl/about/>`__ led by
`Sebastiaan Math√¥t <http://www.cogsci.nl/smathot>`__. In addition, this
repository contains several icons from the `Faenza Icon Set (by Titheum)
<http://tiheum.deviantart.com/art/Faenza-Icons-173323228>`__, which makes us
look professional (please note that some icons have been modified). Further
information regarding the vendorized libraries and their licenses can be found
in the `notice </NOTICE.md>`__ file.

Acknowledgments
---------------

We thank Anja Humbs for her help in selecting the icons and testing the
plug-ins. Besides, we thank the members of the Cognitive Psychology Lab
at the University of Koblenz-Landau for their feedback when using the
plug-ins.
