# Example experiments
This directory contains a number of example experiments that demonstrate how
the psynteract plug-ins can be used:
* [ultimatum_game_minimal.osexp](ultimatum_game_minimal.osexp)
  contains the minimal version of the Ultimatum Game used in the psynteract article
  to demonstrate the basic features of the plug-ins.
  Note that you will probably want to use the slightly extended version below
  which is more robust and uses the communicate plug-in
  (instead of a combination of push, wait, and get).
* [ultimatum_game.osexp](ultimatum_game.osexp)
  contains an exemplary implementation of an Ultimatum Game.
* [prisoners_dilemma_demo.osexp](prisoners_dilemma_demo.osexp)
  contains an exemplary implementation of a Prisoner's Dilemma Game.
