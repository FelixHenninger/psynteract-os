# Example experiments
This directory contains a number of example experiments that demonstrate how
the psynteract plug-ins can be used:
* [prisoners_dilemma_demo.osexp](prisoners_dilemma_demo.osexp)
  contains an exemplary implementation of a Prisoner's Dilemma Game.
* [ultimatum_game.osexp](ultimatum_game.osexp)
  contains an exemplary implementation of an Ultimatum Game.
* [ultimatum_game_minimal.osexp](ultimatum_game_minimal.osexp)
  contains the minimal version of the Ultimatum Game used in the psynteract article.
  Note that you will probably want to use the slightly extended version above
  which is more robust and uses the communicate plug-in
  (instead of a combination of push, wait, and get).
