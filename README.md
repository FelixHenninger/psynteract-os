# Psynteract OpenSesame integration

__Easily build real-time interactive experiments with OpenSesame.__

To *get started* as quickly as possible, please [download the latest release](https://github.com/psynteract/psynteract-os/releases), extract the zip file, and copy the contents of the `extensions` and `plugins` folders to places where OpenSesame can find them, as [described in the OpenSesame documentation](http://osdoc.cogsci.nl/plug-ins/installation/).

## Shoulders of giants

Psynteract depends heavily on several additional libraries that are included in the release archives, but not contained in this repository. In particular, we are indebted to the authors of and contributors to [*PyCouchDB* (written by Andrey Antukh)](https://pycouchdb.readthedocs.org/) and [*Requests* (by Kenneth Reitz and collaborators)](http://python-requests.org/). The OpenSesame integration also incorporates our own [Python library](https://github.com/psynteract/psynteract-py).
In addition, the OpenSesame integration contains several icons from the [Faenza Icon Set](http://tiheum.deviantart.com/art/Faenza-Icons-173323228), which makes us look professional. Further information regarding the vendorized libraries and their licenses can be found in the [notice](/NOTICE.md) file.
