# Psynteract OpenSesame integration

__Easily build real-time interactive experiments with OpenSesame.__

This repository provides the OpenSesame integration of the *Psynteract* libraries.
The documentation of the plug-ins can be found in its [own repository]
(https://github.com/psynteract/psynteract-docs/).


## General information

The psynteract-os plug-ins are developed by Felix Henninger and Pascal Kieslich.
They are published under the [GNU General Public License (version 3)](LICENSE).


## Installation

To install the plug-ins, please [download the latest release](https://github.com/psynteract/psynteract-os/releases).
More information on installing the plug-ins, can be found in the [documentation] (https://github.com/psynteract/psynteract-docs/blob/master/installation.md).


## Shoulders of giants

Psynteract depends heavily on several additional libraries that are included in the release archives, but not contained in this repository. In particular, we are indebted to the authors of and contributors to [*PyCouchDB* (written by Andrey Antukh)](https://pycouchdb.readthedocs.org/) and [*Requests* (by Kenneth Reitz and collaborators)](http://python-requests.org/). The OpenSesame integration also incorporates our own [Python library](https://github.com/psynteract/psynteract-py). Of course, none of this would be possible without the excellent work of the [OpenSesame development team](http://osdoc.cogsci.nl/about/) led by [Sebastiaan Math√¥t](http://www.cogsci.nl/smathot).
In addition, this repository contains several icons from the [Faenza Icon Set (by Titheum)](http://tiheum.deviantart.com/art/Faenza-Icons-173323228), which makes us look professional (please note that some icons have been modified). Further information regarding the vendorized libraries and their licenses can be found in the [notice](/NOTICE.md) file.


## Acknowledgments

We thank Anja Humbs for her help in selecting the icons and testing the plug-ins. Besides, we thank the members of the Cognitive Psychology Lab at the University of Koblenz-Landau for their feedback when using the plug-ins.
